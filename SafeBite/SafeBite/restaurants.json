   "description": "Miss Bao has an Asian fusion inspired menu with share plates in the style of tapas. Our restaurant will feature classical dim sum dishes. We want to innovate traditional Asian dishes by having at least half of the menu composed of vegan, vegetarian and gluten-free items. This choice is vital to our establishment because our plant-based menu options will decrease our ecological footprint.",
